# GPT-3.5 ChatGPT with scikit-learn

This repository demonstrates how to integrate GPT-3.5 (ChatGPT) with scikit-learn for text generation and machine learning tasks.

## Overview

The code in this repository shows how to utilize GPT-3.5 for text generation within a scikit-learn pipeline. GPT-3.5, developed by OpenAI, is a powerful language generation model, and scikit-learn is a widely-used machine learning library in Python.

## Setup

1. **Obtain API Key:**
   Obtain your GPT-3.5 API key from OpenAI. Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your actual API key in the Python code.

2. **Installation:**
   - Clone this repository
   - Install necessary packages

## Usage

1. Open the Python script 
`Utilizing ChatGPT for text generation within a scikit-learn pipeline.ipynb`.

2. Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your GPT-3.5 API key.

3. Run the script: `Utilizing ChatGPT for text generation within a scikit-learn pipeline.ipynb`

## Results

You'll see how GPT-3.5 can be seamlessly integrated into a scikit-learn pipeline for various text generation tasks. Adjust the code to suit your specific use cases.
